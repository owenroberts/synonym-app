path
- fix errors stacking up in URL
	- different error when original search vs plus sign
- don't give errors for plus path button
- don't repeat paths for plus path button
- save swiped out subpaths
- desktop - hover to see left/right arrow for swapping
- lower case letters when caching


idk!!!
- add mongo db
- subpath indexing


later
- show at least one cycle of loading dots on home screen
- browser resize (maybe use css for animation)
- chain.js -- is it word?/does it have synonyms?
- this is unclear, should go over with joel
- update styles when browser is resized
- cache modified paths?
- node number goes to negative/0 when modified chain is longer than original nodelimit, not sure this needs to be fixed
