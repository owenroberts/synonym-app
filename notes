path
- spaces in new paths wtf

idk!!!
- add mongo db
- subpath indexing

later
- show at least one cycle of loading dots on home screen
- browser resize (maybe use css for animation)
- chain.js -- is it word?/does it have synonyms?
- this is unclear, should go over with joel
- update styles when browser is resized
- cache modified paths?
- node number goes to negative/0 when modified chain is longer than original nodelimit, not sure this needs to be fixed
