to do 5.26.2015


priority
- after "no more synonyms in that direction" message all functionality breaks?? also maybe after failing to find shortest path
- replace "no more synonyms in that direction" with jiggle
- paths should be carousel, but with the order preserved
- don't repeat paths for longer path button
- save swiped out subpaths
- show at least one cycle of loading dots on home screen
- after fails to find shortest path, don't need to reload animation
- after shortest path is clicked, option should be grayed out in new path menu
- random new path generation button
- get rid of ui in safari mobile
- desktop - hover to see left/right arrow for swapping


idk!!!
- add mongo db
- subpath indexing


later
- browser resize (maybe use css for animation)
- chain.js -- is it word?/does it have synonyms?
- this is unclear, should go over with joel
- update styles when browser is resized
- cache modified paths?
- node number goes to negative/0 when modified chain is longer than original nodelimit, not sure this needs to be fixed
