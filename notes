	- is two way algorithm okay to move forward?
	- how to interact with definitions - mobile single tap
	- data/analytics stuff, getting all chains
	- modified path sections served in wrong context...

9.1.2017
- can't always reverse engineer synonyms because some hypernyms don't have their hyponym as synonym
- going to serve all results if no matches
- related to sub chains - need to separate loadChain and makeChain so we can distinguish between them, need to use some kind of indexing to make this easier

- decide how to prep data
- implement tooltips
